<p>I received a overwhelming, positive response from week one of my introductory e-mail (and blog post) about updating citizen science and Open Science pages on Wikipedia. Thank you to all who agreed to help! I learned that there is more than updating the pages and adding the missing ones.</p>
<h1>Updates</h1>
<p>• I started the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:CitizenScienceNavBox">navbox</a> with the basics that I know. There are hidden topics under the "Topics" header that need have pages to. I based them of the <a href="https://www.citizenscience.org/association/about/working-groups/">working groups</a> from Citizen Science Association site as I feel that the Association is the umbrella organization for citizen science</p>
<p>• The talk of starting a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Belkinsa/sandbox/OpenCitSciPagesUpdate/Project-Task">WikiProject or Task Force</a> is happening</p>
<p>• A page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Science_Association">Citizen Science Association</a> was created</p>
<h1>Next Steps</h1>
<p>• Start grading the articles within the Citizen Science <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Citizen_science">category</a></p>
<p>• Write the proposal for the WikiProject/Task Force</p>
<p>In the future, the other suggestions that I saw on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Belkinsa/sandbox/OpenCitSciPagesUpdate/Roadmap">talk page</a> of the roadmap will be focused on.</p>
