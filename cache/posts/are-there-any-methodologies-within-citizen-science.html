<p>Once again, the thought about citizen science. This time, it's about the community's methodologies and infrastructures. Before I start, I will define citizen science. In this case, citizen science is science outside academia. From what I seen, it's narrower compared to academic science. It's practiced mostly in the biological (minus cellular and molecular science) and computer science.</p>
<p>The other day I tweeted this and it lead me into posting this:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/OSFramework?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@OSFramework</a> got me thinking about what sorts of infrastructures can work for citizen science. Also the question of what sort sciences work well under citizen science. I only really think of <a href="https://twitter.com/PublicLab?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PublicLab</a> and other biological sciences. Well, maybe computer science also.</p>&mdash; Svetlana Belkin (@senseopenness) <a href="https://twitter.com/senseopenness/status/1092903128448544776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2019</a></blockquote>

<p>To summarize the <a href="https://twitter.com/senseopenness/status/1092903128448544776">full thread</a>,I pondered about the two main non-profit organizations that could help out and these three questions:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Questions to be answered:<br><br>What science topics benefit from citizen scientists? (maybe wrongly worded)<br>What methodologies (including tools) are used and which work the best?<br>What methodologies from that list are used in academia?</p>&mdash; Svetlana Belkin (@senseopenness) <a href="https://twitter.com/senseopenness/status/1092913661713268736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2019</a></blockquote>

<h1>Center for Open Science</h1>
<p>These are the main two methodologies that could be used:</p>
<h2>Open Science Framework (OSF)</h2>
<p>To me, OSF is the better tool than Github because it caters to the Open Science community, although one can link their repo from Github to theirs' on OSF. One can also link their Dropbox, Figshare, and Dataverse accounts. </p>
<h2>Preregistering</h2>
<p>This methodology is very powerful along with roadmapping. Preregistering is different because it, "increases the credibility of hypothesis testing by confirming in advance what will be analyzed and reported" (<a href="https://cos.io/our-communities/scientists-and-researchers/">OSF</a>). A good example is from my wetlands work. If I preregistered my work, I would of had a better sense of what my hypothesis would be and how to go about analyzing the data.</p>
<h1>Mozilla Science Lab</h1>
<p>The Mozilla Science Lab (MSL) mostly has <a href="https://science.mozilla.org/resources">resources</a> on how to start projects, but I can see those being used as methodologies, although I think the OSF is better for infrastructure.</p>
