<p>As I stated before, I switched from WordPress to Nikola but I lost the landing/home page that I had. It's something that I feel a website needs. I tired to use Gandi's free web page hosting service and I was able to create a page but not having it live. I think it's due to Gandi updating their services from v4 to v5. Due to this, I asked a few people and decided to follow what <a href="https://ahoneybun.net/">Aaron Honeycutt</a> did for his landing page. I made some changes though which are the color scheme to match the logo's, made the text to suit my liking, and added a link to my Ubuntu Wiki page.</p>
<p>Like Aaron, I'm using Linode for server hosting. Again, Gandi's Simple Hosting is not being nice.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is the last major change I do for my site.</p>
<p><strong>Edit to Add:</strong> How did I forget to give a <strong><a href="senseopenness.com">LINK</a></strong> to it?</p>
