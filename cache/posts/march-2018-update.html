<p><strong>Hello World!</strong> February and March been crazy months for me and I wanted to write a quick update:</p>
<h1>Blog</h1>
<p>I made two major updates to the blog.</p>
<h2>Tags Rather Than Categorizes</h2>
<p>I have decided to use tags instead of categorizes as Nikola doesn't allow comma separated categorizes. I have found that tags summarize posts better and more is better than one. I also have two posts to write about two programs that I use, which are MPV and CherryTree.</p>
<h2>Personal Links Page</h2>
<p>I decided to get rid of the links list on the footer as I realized how many other profile pages that I have and I want to include all of them. Instead of a footer, I created a personal links page and organized them based on what type of site it is. I also added my Telegram link.</p>
<h1>Grailville Wetlands</h1>
<p>Last month, I finished the data analysis for the two and half data collection seasons and reported the data through a <a href="https://github.com/belkinsa/GrailvilleWetlands/blob/master/WetlandProjectPaper.pdf">paper</a>, restructured the repo, and updated the index page. Most of the lessons that I learned throughout the course of time was more on the Open Science side of things; mostly with how to set up a repo on GitHub and maintaining it. I also gave the materials that are in the repo to Grailville for their archives. As of February 2019, I call the project done, although I may come back to it and work on the research portion of it or even work with the data in R to see if I can replicate the analysis.</p>
<p>As an afterthought, I should called it Project Duckweed as a short name for the project!</p>
<h1>Open Science/Citizen Science</h1>
<p>I'm still drifting with in the communities of Open Science and citizen science trying to find  to work on community development and/or engagement and I haven't had any luck. I had more leads but no go mode yet. The main lead is from the <a href="https://www.citizenscience.org/">Citizen Science Association</a> with their <a href="https://www.citizenscience.org/association/about/working-groups/">working groups</a>. As of now there is not much about these groups but I heard from a Board member that more information will be coming.</p>
<h1>Wikipedia</h1>
<p>I was thinking why I'm having a hard time getting back into volunteering Online is either my weak skill in search kung-fu or place that has a good resource list. In response, I Tweeted this:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There some wiki for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/open?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#open</a> that contains resources for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/openscience?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#openscience</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/citizenscience?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#citizenscience</a>? Something like how <a href="https://twitter.com/LiquipediaNet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LiquipediaNet</a> is set up and how it acts like an umbrella wiki.<br><br> If not, would it be an idea that should be pursued so all of the resources and groups can be in one place?</p>&mdash; Svetlana Belkin (@senseopenness) <a href="https://twitter.com/senseopenness/status/1106612791283195904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 15, 2019</a></blockquote>

<p>then after while, the thought of “oh wait, there is Wikipedia!” came to mind where I <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2019-March/092024.html">posted</a> the same question/though on their mailing-list. And I made the newbish mistake of asking a question where the answer could of been found from doing my homework as the <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2019-March/092026.html">answer</a> stated. I <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2019-March/092027.html">replied</a> admitting that I made the mistake and also the one that I posted to the meta Wikipedia which is the community side of Wikipedia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will take on this advice and start working that on that. As a new contributor, I should take the advice of working on the low-hanging fruit rather than starting big.</p>

<p><a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2019-March/092027.html">reply</a></p>
<p>I starting back at square one as I have when I first started volunteering Online in the Ubuntu Community where worked on keeping the Ubuntu Women and the main wiki up to date. But this time, I feel that I have limited information about the happenings in the Open Science/Citizen Science sector. Also, working alone, while it's okay, is a bit against the values of Open *, collaboration. I'm working on finding people with in the said sector to help me to look through the Wikipedia pages within the sector. If you want to help, please contact me via e-mail (belkinsa@fastmail.com) or via <a href="https://twitter.com/senseopenness">Twitter DM</a> or <a href="https://telegram.me/belkinsa">Telegram</a>.</p>
<p>The next step that I see is to work on a roadmap and maybe post it here for everyone to understand what I'm trying to do. Look for that next month!</p>
