<p>I moved my landing page again but to a better place: <strong>to this blog!</strong> I realized that I'm paying Linode to simply host two pages and images, which is a waste of $7 a month. Luckily, I got my money back from the credit that I had.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, I started to work on moving all the images used in posts and the two pages from the servers of linode back onto my computer in the SenseOpenness folder; which is the nikola folder for my blog.</p>
<h1>What's New</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Off-topic Rambles live on the main blog.</strong> I found that I don't write so many of them and it's easier to maintain one site/blog.</li>
<li><strong>Categories are only used.</strong> In order to be consistent, these categories will be used: Open Source, Open Science, Off-topic, News. I'm planning to work on descriptions for each of them and have the <a href="https://belkinsa.github.io/SenseOpenness/categories/">categories</a> page display them.</li>
<li><strong>Other Personal Links live in footer.</strong> To me, it looks better when the links are in vertical line rather than in a horizontal line. Plus, they are on all of the pages now.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What's Next</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Different Theme.</strong> I might change the colors of the theme that comes with the basic theme or I will play around with <a href="https://themes.getnikola.com/">another</a>.</li>
<li><strong>My wetlands work will live on the site.</strong> This is for the ease of reading the markdown files.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read the instructions!!!</strong> If I read the instructions, things would be simpler.</li>
</ul>
