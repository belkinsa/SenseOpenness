<p>As I said in the <a href="/posts/december-2018-update">December 2018 update</a>, the <a href="/pages/wetlands/index.html">Wetlands</a> pages live on this blog for the ease of viewing the markdown files. Some of the pages are combined because they are related to each other and the flow is better. An example is the write up and the findings are under write ups now because the findings were really from the research about the two ponds themselves from official sources. I also looked at what I have done and I found that I didn't do that much as I wanted to. Lucky I'm doing this a volunteering thing rather than for school, so that means I don't have a deadline for when I need the work done. Well, maybe a deadline but one that isn't so strict which will be made for sometime next year.</p>
<p>I also added a page that lists the <a href="/pages/programs-that-i-use">programs</a> where I link the official information sites/pages and my reviews. </p>
