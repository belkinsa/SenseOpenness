<p>I'm a digital note-taker/planner. Personally I use a hierarchical note-taking program called CherryTree. I kept both spiral-bound notebooks and binders when I was young but I found any methods to keep the pages in order. Luckily, during college and as a fledgling Linux user, I found various note-taking programs from Evernote to KeepNote to CherryTree. I drifted around between many of these and finally settled down on CherryTree. It gives me the power to create nodes within nodes in order to organize the games that I play and also GM. As a GM, the structure that works for me is the within the game system node that the game will be then I will have sub-nodes of the sessions (if not a one-shot), the setting, PC info, and NPC info.  Within those sub-nodes, I create nodes based on what I need.  Sometimes, I do that one more time before working on writing things in those nodes. <strong>Example:</strong> D&amp;D &gt; Torzukarr &gt; Setting Info &gt; Races.</p>
