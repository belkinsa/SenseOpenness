<p>As I stated previously, I switched from WordPress to Nikola for hosting my blog. Here, I want to explain more in depth on why Nikola is, to me, the best choice for a static generator.</p>
<h1>Over WordPress</h1>
<p>Over that year when my blog was down, I think WordPress made some changes with their WordPress importer and I wasn't able to import from my backup file that I had. That's one reason there. I can list the other reasons along with the <a href="https://getnikola.com/features/index.html">reasons</a> stated on the Nikola's official site:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is a built-in way to write in Markdown and have it phrased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A text editor of your own choice is used. Some times that is better than the web based editor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The files are stored locally and on a server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GitHub/GitHub Pages/GitLab can be used to host.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The themes are better becuase they don't have the side bar on the left-hand side.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Over Jekyll</h1>
<p>I also considered using Jekyll, but I found it harder to use as a first time user of Jekyll and also for static site generators. Also <strong>(I think)</strong>, your file formats for posts must be in a certain way.</p>
