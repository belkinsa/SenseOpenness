<p>I'm recently trying to get myself back into community building and this time with citizen science! In the last two and half years, my voluteering lead to citizen science as my work is for Grailville. Since Grailville is not tied to an academic institution or a research institution, my work is considered to be under the citizen science umbrella although I worked solo on it.</p>
<p>Before this post, I was only aware of Mozilla Science Lab (MSL), Public Lab, and Zooniverse. After <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/openscienceframework/MQiisZpavOk">asking around</a> on the Center for Open Science Framework, I found about the <a href="https://www.citizenscience.org/">Citizen Science Association</a>.</p>
<p>The first seven are coming from when I was active in the Ubuntu Community and the last two are from what I seen used in Open Science communities, mainly from Mozilla Science Lab and Public Lab.</p>
<h1>Wiki</h1>
<p>Wikis are one of the best infrastructures for any Open * community. They allow the most collaboration because anyone, with an account, can create and edit pages. These pages can be member profiles or pages that relate to teams and/or projects.</p>
<p>The downside to this is </p>
<p>Below are systems that can be well tied with the wiki as they use the wiki to keep information.</p>
<h2>Member Profiles</h2>
<p>I like this through the wiki because users can easily create and edit their profile. This <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MembershipTemplate">template</a> is my favorite.</p>
<h2>Teams/Projects</h2>
<h1>Mailing-lists</h1>
<h1>Discourse Forums</h1>
<h1>IRC/Telegram Groups/Discord Groups</h1>
<h1>Planet</h1>
<h1>Monthly Community Calls</h1>
<h1>Open Badges</h1>
