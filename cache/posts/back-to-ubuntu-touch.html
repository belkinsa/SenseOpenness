<p>Over the last month, I thought about buying a new phone and the thought process was this:</p>
<p>The phone must be/have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A non-Samsung or iPhone</strong> While they are best of the best, they are just over advertised. Plus, they cost above my pay rate.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy, please</strong> It's something that we have, as a whole, thrown away. Also, that FaceTime bug is scary.</li>
<li><strong>It needs to be simple</strong> I'm still leaning on using my computer for my work. I only use my phone to make calls, text, and check my e-mail and Twitter.</li>
<li><strong>It needs to be rootable</strong> What if I want to switch back to Android? Plus, how would I of switched to Ubuntu Touch in the first place? If I were to switch back to Android, I would use the stock ROM- no need for bloat-ware.</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided to buy a Nexus 5 and put Ubuntu Touch on it. I used to have a Nexus 4, but it was water damaged. I bought it because I wanted a bigger screen although I think based on the usage, the Nexus 4 would of worked.</p>
<h1>Review</h1>
<p>I don't recall if I wrote a proper review on Ubuntu Touch, but I will here. Like as I said I don't really use my phone and I will not be reviewing the convergence part.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Installation was much easier after <a href="https://ubports.com/">Ubports</a> took over the project because they added a GUI method to flashing Ubuntu Touch on devices. The the only problem that I found is that Nexus 5 wasn't found automatically. Luckily, the installer has a manual selection.</p>

<h2>System</h2>
<p>Overall, it's a nice and stable system. I don't see any major changes from when I last used it. The only bad thing is that the Weather app doesn't work outside the box. You will have to update it from the Ubuntu Open Store.</p>
<h1>Apps</h1>
<p>The Apps I have on my Ubuntu Touch are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base, pre-installed apps minus Notes</strong> I don't use Evernote but I may need a basic noting taking app. The others are needed for everyday life.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://open-store.io/app/activescreen.mivoligo">Active Screen</a></strong> It replaces the "always on while charging" setting from Android. I may have use for it, but I don't yet.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://open-store.io/app/circle-message.mivoligo">Circle Message</a></strong> It's there for motivation.</li>
<li><strong>Morph Browser</strong> While it's one of the base, pre-installed apps, it the most powerful app on the Ubuntu Touch. Most of the apps that I used on my Samsung Galaxy Edge are web-based apps, such as Twitter and e-mail.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://open-store.io/app/talaan.kugiigi">Talaan</a></strong> It's a pretty good check-list app.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://open-store.io/app/ut-tweak-tool.sverzegnassi">UT Tweak Tool</a></strong> Because there are some settings that aren't found the system settings, such as turning off the launcher.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Other</h1>
