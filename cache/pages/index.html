<h1>What is the “Sense of Openness”?</h1>

<p>Many words in the English language have two types of meanings: the literal meaning and a meaning that is tied to culture. For example, the word “sense” in my case. The cultural meaning of sense is tied to spiritualism and it's something that shouldn't tied with science. One of the literal meanings of sense is understanding. In my case, the literal meaning should be applied as it sounds the most reasonable.
</p>
<p>Openness on the other hand is used to define a movement where “accommodating attitude or opinion, as in receptivity to new ideas, behaviors, cultures, peoples, environments, experiences, etc., different from the familiar, conventional, traditional, or one's own" (<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/openness">Wiktionary</a>).
</p>
<p>There are many ways to get a “sense” of openness. As an example, there are five highest values that were picked up by Svetlana from her volunteering in these various Open * communities. The five senses chosen have more of the cultural meaning rather than the literal meaning as a play on wording.

<p><b>Sense of <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/knowledge">knowledge</a>:</b>  Everyone knows the saying “knowledge is power” and it can be applied to all Open * Communities. It's the key for both personal, and the Community development, because one applies it in order to learn and grow.
