<h1>Research Plan</h1>
<h2>2017</h2>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Research on <strong>what</strong> first...</li>
<li>...<strong>why</strong> next...</li>
<li>...then <strong>who</strong>...</li>
<li>...and last but not least <strong>how</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, I was having fun when I wrote this on paper and couldn't resist on not keeping it!</p>
<p><strong>In translation...</strong></p>
<p>Understanding <strong>what</strong> first will allow me to understand <strong>why</strong> then <strong>who</strong> and last but not least <strong>how</strong> to make impact within/for wetlands.</p>
<p>The point is I feel that, from my very basic understanding of what a wetland is, I'm not getting anywhere near creating solutions for maintaining a pond organically.</p>
<h3>What I know already</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>What</strong> are wetlands?</li>
<li>Natural</li>
<li>Constructed</li>
<li>(<strong>What</strong>)It's a habitat (Midwest, Ohio, Southwestern Ohio)</li>
<li>(<strong>How</strong>)Monitoring through:<ul>
<li>Chemical</li>
<li>Data loggers</li>
<li><a href="https://publiclab.org/">Mapping kits</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(<strong>Who</strong>)<a href="https://publiclab.org/">Public Lab</a>, EPA</li>
<li>(<strong>Who,What</strong>)<a href="http://urbanriv.org/">Urban Rivers</a> and their floats and system</li>
<li>(<strong>What</strong>)Basic Chemistry</li>
</ol>
<h3>What I want know (in the same order as above)</h3>
<ol>
<li>(<strong>What</strong>)Differences between the two types of wetlands</li>
<li>(<strong>What</strong>)Keystone and interactions</li>
<li>(<strong>How, Why</strong>)Impact that other than to keep water clean and livable</li>
<li>(<strong>Who</strong>)Any wetlands only groups/orgs</li>
<li>(<strong>Who,How</strong>)Would their idea worth to use in wetlands</li>
<li>(<strong>What,Why</strong>)More in depth and why it works when it's works</li>
</ol>
