<h1>2017</h1>
<h2>March</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>27th: Started data collection season and did an examination of the small pond. Here are the findings (with <a href="https://github.com/belkinsa/GrailvilleWetlands/tree/master/notes/photos/03-27-2017_findings">photos</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Found an oily residue near the data collecting edge/point</li>
<li>There is life:<ul>
<li>Frogs and tadpoles</li>
<li>A snapping turtule</li>
<li>Traces of duckweed</li>
<li>Blades of grass-like plants</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>May</h2>
<ul>
<li>8th: Duckweed is covering the whole surface of the small pond.</li>
</ul>
<h2>June</h2>
<ul>
<li>19th: Added a nibbler to the small pond on the deck end</li>
<li>26th: The hurricane/tropical storm before Dora's rain filled the ponds to the edges and maybe a bit more. Also in the small pond, the yarrow maybe be dieing, oberved over a month. Comfrey is still alive.</li>
</ul>
<h2>July</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>10th- Heavy downpour occured late last week with some hail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>17th- Heavy douwnpour occured mid last week. A nibbler was placed in the small pond in the data collection point. One of the conferies are blooming.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>August</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>21st- Placed a nibbler to the small pond on the data collection side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>28th- It rained that week.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>September</h2>
<ul>
<li>17th- Placed a nibbler on the dock side of the small pond.  It rained last week.</li>
</ul>
<h2>October</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>16th- The rafts were removed from the small ponds. None of the orginal plants were alive but the aquatic plants took over and grew in the spots.  Four plants types were found</p>
<ul>
<li>One with big, broad, fuzzy leaves</li>
<li>Wheat-grass like plant with long, narrow leaves</li>
<li>Olive-green stemed plant with small, narrow, serrated leaves</li>
<li>Ground cover-like plant with small green-reddish leaves</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This could explain the raise in the average pH compared to last year.</p>
<p>The big pond has 10% - 20 % duckweed, ~80% has died off.</p>
<ul>
<li>23rd- It rained during data collection. The big pond as ~70% duckweed.</li>
