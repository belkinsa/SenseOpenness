<p>Because it's becoming the end of the season, it's too late to add fish to the small pond.  That will be done next year.</p>
<h1>Duckweed</h1>
<p>Since there is no fish in the pond, there is no way to clean up the duckweed without removing it manually.  The only idea is to "harvest" it, meaning that we (Grailville) offer those who wish to use it for cooking, feed, and fertilizer for free.</p>
<h1>Muck</h1>
<p>Continue using the nibblers.  Try to get one in the middle of the pond, but away from the edge by the dock.</p>
<h1>Plants</h1>
<p>Move them away from the edge.</p>
<h1>Equipment Needed</h1>
