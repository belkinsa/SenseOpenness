<p>N/A</p>
<h1>Plants</h1>
<p>One possible experiment could be having the small rafts just have pots with soil and fiber and allow the aquatic plants to live for a season.</p>
<h1>Duckweed</h1>
<p>Try to find the source of the pollution rather than removing the duckweed. <strong>Rationale:</strong> Duckweed thrives on unhealthy ponds.</p>
<h1>Pond Aeration</h1>
<p>Try to remove the aerator from the big pond and place it in the small pond. <strong>Rationale:</strong> As said above, a possible source of pollution is the lack of dissolved oxygen.</p>
<p><strong>03/01/18:</strong> Found out that the aerator is broken, nothing can be done.</p>
<h1>Muck</h1>
<p>Use nibblers like in 2016 and 2017.</p>
