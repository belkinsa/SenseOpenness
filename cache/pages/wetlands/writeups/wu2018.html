<h2>Analysis</h2>
<h3>Big Pond</h3>

<h3>Small Pond</h3>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The pH levels are stable in both ponds but it's hard to say if the levels are stable since these are once a week data point, at almost the same time, collections not 24/7 sensor collection.</p>
<h2>Other Notes</h2>
<p>I realized my mistake on how I formatted the date data and fixed into week number, yy instead of mm,dd,yy. I used LibreOffice Calc to convert the date into week number based on the year and concatenating the year to 20yy, as I only had it in the two digit format. Function used: <code>=WEEKNUM(DATE(CONCATENATE(20,D2),A2,B2))</code></p>
<h3>What I Learned</h3>
<h4>During the Data Collection Seasons</h4>
<p>The final data collection season ended on the last week of October of 2018 and I learned  that using peat moss does not allow growth of native plants. If I had an extra season or two, the next step of the experiment would of been to plant the yarrow and comfrey in the fall before and winter them for 2019.</p>
<h4>Open Science</h4>
<p>The reason why chose to do this project is I have the permission to upload the data and my work to the public domain. In return, I learned how to structure the <a href="https://github.com/belkinsa/GrailvilleWetlands">repo</a> on GitHub and here, how format a .csv file, and what organizations are doing wetlands work in the realm of Open Science.</p>
<p>I'm still working on this project, mostly data processing and research, and I will add my findings under the year that I did the work in.</p>
