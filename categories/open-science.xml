Thank you to all who agreed to help! I learned that there is more than updating the pages and adding the missing ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• I started the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:CitizenScienceNavBox"&gt;navbox&lt;/a&gt; with the basics that I know. There are hidden topics under the "Topics" header that need have pages to. I based them of the &lt;a href="https://www.citizenscience.org/association/about/working-groups/"&gt;working groups&lt;/a&gt; from Citizen Science Association site as I feel that the Association is the umbrella organization for citizen science&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• The talk of starting a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Belkinsa/sandbox/OpenCitSciPagesUpdate/Project-Task"&gt;WikiProject or Task Force&lt;/a&gt; is happening&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• A page for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Science_Association"&gt;Citizen Science Association&lt;/a&gt; was created&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Start grading the articles within the Citizen Science &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Citizen_science"&gt;category&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Write the proposal for the WikiProject/Task Force&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, the other suggestions that I saw on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Belkinsa/sandbox/OpenCitSciPagesUpdate/Roadmap"&gt;talk page&lt;/a&gt; of the roadmap will be focused on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Citizen Science</category><category>News</category><category>Open Science</category><category>Project</category><category>Roadmap</category><category>Wikipedia</category><guid>https://belkinsa.github.io/SenseOpenness/blog/open-cit-sci-pages-update-on-wikipedia-april-2019-update/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 11:11:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Announcing Open Cit Sci Pages Update On Wikipedia</title><link>https://belkinsa.github.io/SenseOpenness/blog/announcing-open-cit-sci-pages-update-on-wikipedia/</link><dc:creator>Svetlana Belkin</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both movements of Citizen and Open Science have evolved quickly in the last ten years, but many of the Wikipedia pages are outdated. It's is up the community to update these pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of April 2nd, a project over on Wikipedia was started and is looking for experts within the Community to update the pages. Currently the project has a rough &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Belkinsa/sandbox/OpenCitSciPagesUpdateRoadmap&amp;amp;oldid=890798803"&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt; that you can look at and a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Belkinsa/sandbox/OpenCitSciPagesUpdateRoadmap"&gt;Talk page&lt;/a&gt; where the discussions will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward into working with some of you on this!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Citizen Science</category><category>News</category><category>Open Science</category><category>Project</category><category>Roadmap</category><category>Wikipedia</category><guid>https://belkinsa.github.io/SenseOpenness/blog/announcing-open-cit-sci-pages-update-on-wikipedia/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2019 17:26:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>March 2018 Update</title><link>https://belkinsa.github.io/SenseOpenness/blog/march-2018-update/</link><dc:creator>Svetlana Belkin</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello World!&lt;/strong&gt; February and March been crazy months for me and I wanted to write a quick update:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made two major updates to the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tags Rather Than Categorizes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have decided to use tags instead of categorizes as Nikola doesn't allow comma separated categorizes. I have found that tags summarize posts better and more is better than one. I also have two posts to write about two programs that I use, which are MPV and CherryTree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Personal Links Page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to get rid of the links list on the footer as I realized how many other profile pages that I have and I want to include all of them. Instead of a footer, I created a personal links page and organized them based on what type of site it is. I also added my Telegram link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grailville Wetlands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, I finished the data analysis for the two and half data collection seasons and reported the data through a &lt;a href="https://github.com/belkinsa/GrailvilleWetlands/blob/master/WetlandProjectPaper.pdf"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, restructured the repo, and updated the index page. Most of the lessons that I learned throughout the course of time was more on the Open Science side of things; mostly with how to set up a repo on GitHub and maintaining it. I also gave the materials that are in the repo to Grailville for their archives. As of February 2019, I call the project done, although I may come back to it and work on the research portion of it or even work with the data in R to see if I can replicate the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an afterthought, I should called it Project Duckweed as a short name for the project!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open Science/Citizen Science&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still drifting with in the communities of Open Science and citizen science trying to find  to work on community development and/or engagement and I haven't had any luck. I had more leads but no go mode yet. The main lead is from the &lt;a href="https://www.citizenscience.org/"&gt;Citizen Science Association&lt;/a&gt; with their &lt;a href="https://www.citizenscience.org/association/about/working-groups/"&gt;working groups&lt;/a&gt;. As of now there is not much about these groups but I heard from a Board member that more information will be coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking why I'm having a hard time getting back into volunteering Online is either my weak skill in search kung-fu or place that has a good resource list. In response, I Tweeted this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There some wiki for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/open?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#open&lt;/a&gt; that contains resources for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/openscience?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#openscience&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/citizenscience?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#citizenscience&lt;/a&gt;? Something like how &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LiquipediaNet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@LiquipediaNet&lt;/a&gt; is set up and how it acts like an umbrella wiki.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; If not, would it be an idea that should be pursued so all of the resources and groups can be in one place?&lt;/p&gt;— Svetlana Belkin (@senseopenness) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/senseopenness/status/1106612791283195904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 15, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then after while, the thought of “oh wait, there is Wikipedia!” came to mind where I &lt;a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2019-March/092024.html"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; the same question/though on their mailing-list. And I made the newbish mistake of asking a question where the answer could of been found from doing my homework as the &lt;a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2019-March/092026.html"&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; stated. I &lt;a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2019-March/092027.html"&gt;replied&lt;/a&gt; admitting that I made the mistake and also the one that I posted to the meta Wikipedia which is the community side of Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will take on this advice and start working that on that. As a new contributor, I should take the advice of working on the low-hanging fruit rather than starting big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2019-March/092027.html"&gt;reply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I starting back at square one as I have when I first started volunteering Online in the Ubuntu Community where worked on keeping the Ubuntu Women and the main wiki up to date. But this time, I feel that I have limited information about the happenings in the Open Science/Citizen Science sector. Also, working alone, while it's okay, is a bit against the values of Open *, collaboration. I'm working on finding people with in the said sector to help me to look through the Wikipedia pages within the sector. If you want to help, please contact me via e-mail (belkinsa@fastmail.com) or via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/senseopenness"&gt;Twitter DM&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://telegram.me/belkinsa"&gt;Telegram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step that I see is to work on a roadmap and maybe post it here for everyone to understand what I'm trying to do. Look for that next month!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Citizen Science</category><category>Grailville Wetlands</category><category>News</category><category>Open Science</category><category>Wikipedia</category><guid>https://belkinsa.github.io/SenseOpenness/blog/march-2018-update/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2019 20:37:44 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
