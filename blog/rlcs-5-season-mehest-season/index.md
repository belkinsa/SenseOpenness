Before I start the post, I want to explain the title of the post. I wanted to say the "lamest season" but my mind wants me to say "mehest season". I decided to leave it as the "mehest season" instead of "lamest season".  They are basically the same to me.

I said that I'm a fan of watching Rocket League as a E-Sport and I watched most of the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS) from the LAN of Season 2 to (as the time of writing) the regionals of Season 5. At the beginning of Season 3, I was hyped to watch each week and that stayed until Week 3 of Season 5. Season 5 was just the mehest season.

I'm aware that I do phase out of things pretty quickly and I think this is one of those things.

#Reasons Why

**No RLCS Overtime Show**

I enjoyed watching the VOD of RLCS Overtime because I liked hearing the casters' afterthoughts on the matches of the past weekend since I don't follow Rocket League news outside RLCS. I don't know why they didn't decide to do it this season perhaps it's because they have a new studio.

**Karma being the only female pro**

Rocket League like all other E-sports are male dominated but there are at least one female pro. The one that I can name is [Karma](https://twitter.com/KarmahTV) of [Splyce](https://splyce.gg/). She grinded since (I think) Season 2 and she and her teammates finally made it to the Rival Series. After the play-ins, they only won two of their seven games. I feel like the pressure on Karma being the only female pro in the season. Or maybe the other teams got stronger.

**Same players/teams every season**

Sure, I do enjoy watching players being amazing or their growth but the problem is when they weaken it hurts to watch them play and lose. Plus I like seeing new rookies.

**No Player Rewards (sorry for the lack of the right word) for top in stats**

I'm just a casual watcher and I don't keep track of stats or follow someone who does. Because of this, I lose track of stats and who is in the lead for certain stats.

**No Team Stats during the five minute break between matches on game day**

Again for the same reason as above.

**Some of the Top 5's were poorly picked**

This is a minor reason but this [video's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL59TL9r9rs) comments explains why. This tweet is the biggest reason on why I included this reason:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/KarmahTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@KarmahTV</a>  Is this true? I saw this a comment on this video, &quot;They had to put Karma&#39;s shot in there otherwise therd be triggered femenists&quot; (VSME). And is this effecting your gameplay? <a href="https://t.co/Xss8kDKYlc">https://t.co/Xss8kDKYlc</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@YouTube</a></p>&mdash; Svetlana Belkin (@senseopenness) <a href="https://twitter.com/senseopenness/status/983638874613313537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 10, 2018</a></blockquote>

**Seasons are too short**

Other E-Sports championships are much longer than five weeks of league play and a LAN. For some reason, this season went by really fast.

Hopefully next season is better.  Who knows.
