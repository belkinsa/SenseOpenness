As I stated previously, I switched from WordPress to Nikola for hosting my blog. Here, I want to explain more in depth on why Nikola is, to me, the best choice for a static generator.

#Over WordPress

Over that year when my blog was down, I think WordPress made some changes with their WordPress importer and I wasn't able to import from my backup file that I had. That's one reason there. I can list the other reasons along with the [reasons](https://getnikola.com/features/index.html) stated on the Nikola's official site:

- There is a built-in way to write in Markdown and have it phrased.

- A text editor of your own choice is used. Some times that is better than the web based editor.

- The files are stored locally and on a server.

- GitHub/GitHub Pages/GitLab can be used to host.

- The themes are better becuase they don't have the side bar on the left-hand side.

#Over Jekyll

I also considered using Jekyll, but I found it harder to use as a first time user of Jekyll and also for static site generators. Also **(I think)**, your file formats for posts must be in a certain way.
