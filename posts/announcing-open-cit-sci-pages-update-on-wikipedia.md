Both movements of Citizen and Open Science have evolved quickly in the last ten years, but many of the Wikipedia pages are outdated. It's is up the community to update these pages.

As of April 2nd, a project over on Wikipedia was started and is looking for experts within the Community to update the pages. Currently the project has a rough [roadmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Belkinsa/sandbox/OpenCitSciPagesUpdateRoadmap&oldid=890798803) that you can look at and a [Talk page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Belkinsa/sandbox/OpenCitSciPagesUpdateRoadmap) where the discussions will happen.

I look forward into working with some of you on this!
