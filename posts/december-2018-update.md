I moved my landing page again but to a better place: **to this blog!** I realized that I'm paying Linode to simply host two pages and images, which is a waste of $7 a month. Luckily, I got my money back from the credit that I had.

Earlier this month, I started to work on moving all the images used in posts and the two pages from the servers of linode back onto my computer in the SenseOpenness folder; which is the nikola folder for my blog.

#What's New

- **Off-topic Rambles live on the main blog.** I found that I don't write so many of them and it's easier to maintain one site/blog.
- **Categories are only used.** In order to be consistent, these categories will be used: Open Source, Open Science, Off-topic, News. I'm planning to work on descriptions for each of them and have the [categories](https://belkinsa.github.io/SenseOpenness/categories/) page display them.
- **Other Personal Links live in footer.** To me, it looks better when the links are in vertical line rather than in a horizontal line. Plus, they are on all of the pages now.

#What's Next

- **Different Theme.** I might change the colors of the theme that comes with the basic theme or I will play around with [another](https://themes.getnikola.com/).
- - **My wetlands work will live on the site.** This is for the ease of reading the markdown files.

#Lessons Learned

- **Read the instructions!!!** If I read the instructions, things would be simpler.
