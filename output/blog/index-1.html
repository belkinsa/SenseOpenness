<p>Resisting change can be a blessing and a cruse and resisting changing to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is a cruse. While I'm sad that I leaving Unity behind, due to some issues on 16.04 LTS, I'm glad that I decided to switch. Though I do miss Unity.</p>
<p>I decided to do a minimal install instead of a full one because there are many programs that I do need.  I only need Firefox, PDF Reader,video player, and the core system programs. The rest of the programs that I need, including ReText and the System76 drivers, aren't included in the full install. Over the last years, I noticed that I don't use LibreOffice or the music player.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<ul>
<li>Minimal installation option</li>
<li>Calendar apps such as GNOME Calendar and Evolution are better integrated with the top panel. Though it would be cool to see To Do tasks</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<ul>
<li>ReText is not integrated in the dock, it opens another instance on the dock, if favored.</li>
<li>Nautilus doesn't have the integrated bookmarked folders in the dock when right clicked on the icon</li>
<li>No recent files on the Dash of the dock (can't think of the term)</li>
</ul>

<p>I said that I'm a fan of watching Rocket League as a E-Sport and I watched most of the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS) from the LAN of Season 2 to (as the time of writing) the regionals of Season 5. At the beginning of Season 3, I was hyped to watch each week and that stayed until Week 3 of Season 5. Season 5 was just the mehest season.</p>
<p>I'm aware that I do phase out of things pretty quickly and I think this is one of those things.</p>
<h2>Reasons Why</h2>
<p><strong>No RLCS Overtime Show</strong></p>
<p>I enjoyed watching the VOD of RLCS Overtime because I liked hearing the casters' afterthoughts on the matches of the past weekend since I don't follow Rocket League news outside RLCS. I don't know why they didn't decide to do it this season perhaps it's because they have a new studio.</p>
<p><strong>Karma being the only female pro</strong></p>
<p>Rocket League like all other E-sports are male dominated but there are at least one female pro. The one that I can name is <a href="https://twitter.com/KarmahTV">Karma</a> of <a href="https://splyce.gg/">Splyce</a>. She grinded since (I think) Season 2 and she and her teammates finally made it to the Rival Series. After the play-ins, they only won two of their seven games. I feel like the pressure on Karma being the only female pro in the season. Or maybe the other teams got stronger.</p>
<p><strong>Same players/teams every season</strong></p>
<p>Sure, I do enjoy watching players being amazing or their growth but the problem is when they weaken it hurts to watch them play and lose. Plus I like seeing new rookies.</p>
<p><strong>No Player Rewards (sorry for the lack of the right word) for top in stats</strong></p>
<p>I'm just a casual watcher and I don't keep track of stats or follow someone who does. Because of this, I lose track of stats and who is in the lead for certain stats.</p>
<p><strong>No Team Stats during the five minute break between matches on game day</strong></p>
<p>Again for the same reason as above.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the Top 5's were poorly picked</strong></p>
<p>This is a minor reason but this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL59TL9r9rs">video's</a> comments explains why. This tweet is the biggest reason on why I included this reason:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/KarmahTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@KarmahTV</a>  Is this true? I saw this a comment on this video, "They had to put Karma's shot in there otherwise therd be triggered femenists" (VSME). And is this effecting your gameplay? <a href="https://t.co/Xss8kDKYlc">https://t.co/Xss8kDKYlc</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@YouTube</a></p>— Svetlana Belkin (@senseopenness) <a href="https://twitter.com/senseopenness/status/983638874613313537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 10, 2018</a>
</blockquote>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p><strong>Seasons are too short</strong></p>
<p>Other E-Sports championships are much longer than five weeks of league play and a LAN. For some reason, this season went by really fast.</p>
<p>Hopefully next season is better.  Who knows.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As I said in the <a href="https://belkinsa.github.io/SenseOpenness/posts/why-plaintext/">last post</a>, I found a great Markdown editor called <a href="https://github.com/ReText-project/ReText">ReText</a>. I decided to write a review on the program, but for that, I wanted to show what preferences I have on.  I'm not sure if those would effect the review.</p>
<p><img src="../images/reTextPreferencesB.png"></p>
<p><img src="../images/reTextPreferencesE.png"></p>
<p><img src="../images/reTextPreferencesI.png"></p>
<h2>The Review</h2>
<h3>Ratings</h3>
<h4>UX</h4>
<p>I'm giving UX a 7.5/10. Reason number one is there is no find/find-replace button on the tool bar. The next reason is there is no way to customize the tool bar. The third reason is the line counter hides the text when text is in that corner of the screen</p>
<p><img src="../images/LineNumberHidingText.png"></p>
<p>but it fades out when cursor is on it</p>
<p><img src="../images/FadeWhenCursorOnIt.png"></p>
<p>Next is the symbols need to be defined; I don't really use symbols and some of those, such as &amp; larr ; (without spaces); I don't know. I  Last but not least, the images don't show up on the live previewer. I have to use <a href="http://markdownlivepreview.com/">Markdown Preview</a>, a web-based tool to check the images.</p>
<p><img src="../images/ImagesDontShow.png"></p>
<h4>Performance</h4>
<p>I'm giving performance a 10/10 because it only uses less than 100 MiB of memory and I had no big issues with it yet.</p>
<h4>Features</h4>
<p>I'm giving features a 10/10 because as you can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It can export in HTML, ODT, and PDF</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can have multiple documents open in tabs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can view other plaintext files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fullscreen works in the latest version</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ReText-project/reTextReview/wiki/Table-editing-mode">Table editing/formating</a> is much easier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has auto-fill for numbered and un-numbered lists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has a live previewer and a normal one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can show where the white spaces are</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can show what line you are on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It allows you to move lines up or down with a click of a button or a keyboard shortcut</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can show what line number you are on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can auto-save documents and auto-open last documents on start-up with window geometry from the last session</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It allows reStructuredText editing with previewer along with the default Markdown editing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has a spell-checker</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has a HTML code viewer of the document that is opened</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can show what directory the file is sitting in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can insert certain symbols in text, for example: ←</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has <a href="https://github.com/ReText-project/reTextReview/wiki">other features</a> that are cool</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, I'm giving ReText a 9/10 because the features and the performance wins out over the UX.</p>

<p>Back in September of 2013, I wrote a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180226181935/https://torzukarr.wordpress.com/2013/09/08/blast-in-the-past/">post</a> about who I was back in the 2000's. The other day, I was thinking about what I was doing 15 years ago which took me back to 2005 and based on that post, that was during being on deviantArt (dA), Neopets, Furcadia and my Sonic the Hedgehog, Pokemon and Megaman EXE fandom period. This was also a year before I built my first custom computer with my dad and getting my first drawing tablet. I'm not trying to summarize that post or shameless plugging it for you all to read. Instead I want to do a response to it because I clearly feel that there are places where I didn't explain myself well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Forgot to add:</strong> The game Puzzle Pirates by ThreeRings Design taught me to type in proper English around 2005-2006 after I build my computer.  I was just standing in (I think) the Dragon’s Nest’s Inn and watching how players were speaking.  And one caught my eye and I started to copy of that player.  The only thing is I can’t find any examples of my improper English.  I think that was on Furcadia when I was on it before 2005.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote is half true. i may of had improper english (as an example), but it only showed when I played MMOPRG's. What I had, like most kids, was inmaturarty (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040414185315/http://neosvetlana.deviantart.com:80/">example 1</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060418010901/http://neosvetlana.deviantart.com:80/">example 2</a> mainly the journal entires and the Devious Information). I also copied how other deviants did their journal entries.</p>
<p>Based on what I was doing back in the 2000's, it seemed that I wanted to create Online content. Which did translate into the 2010 decade. The proof is in this quote, "I think I also wanted to write stories and comics for the online Neopets newspaper". What I didn't really do was to follow through, but I can't really blame myself- I was a kid and I didn't care about the lore of Neopets. Which is a shame because I could of learned how to write fan-fiction, which could of lead to fiction writing.</p>
<p>Regardless on what I could of done, what I did back than shaped me into who I am now. After building Neopets pet pages and creating blogs/sites, that made want to own a domain from very early on. Which I finally have. But I don't know how much of the 2000's me is left. The only thing that I know is that my drawing/painting style hasn't changed and the will to content creation is still strong, maybe stronger than ever.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, I saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/jrgifford/status/968136838706810882">tweet</a> about plain text productivity and like what James Gifford said, it is a "really interesting idea". This tweet stuck out me not for the productivity side of things but in terms of workflow. I ditched hierarchical note taking programs (KeepNote and Cherry Tree as examples) because I noticed that I never really used them and I was over complicating things. But the one thing that stayed with me is the use of Plain Text, A.K.A writing in Markdown. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be used everywhere- only need a text editor</li>
<li>Can still have formating via markup languages</li>
<li>Small file size</li>
<li>Copy and pasting is easier because the formating is lost in Plain Text</li>
</ul>
<p>And these pros win over the two cons that I can name:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can't really do the classic outline formating.  The closest that I have is this (with spaces between the lines):</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h2>Header 1</h2>
<h3>Header 2</h3>
<ol>
<li>Ordered Item 1</li>
</ol>
<p>(Tab or four (4) lines) Unordered Item 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><img src="../images/OutlineinMarkdown.png"></p>
<p>This outline system allows you to write content without using classic outlining formating if you want to write longer items for each points without making it hard to read.</p>
<ul>
<li>The need for a previewer for markup languages</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently I found a Markdown editor/live previewer called <a href="https://github.com/ReText-project/ReText">ReText</a> which, to me, is better than GitHub's Atom or QOwnNotes. </p>
<p>The reason, over Atom, is ReText dedicated for Markdown but you can still open other plain text files.  Atom is also really meant for developers. Over QOwnNotes, ReText is not a hierarchical note taking program.</p>
<p>This is how I draft in Markdown in ReText:
<img src="../images/DraftingMarkdown.png"></p>
<p>It seems that working in the Open is allowing me to think in different ways of how to do thing and this is one example.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT TO ADD:</strong> I forgot to talk about  that Plain Text formats don't change over versions of programs and the formats are mostly Open.</p>

<p>As I stated previously, I switched from WordPress to Nikola for hosting my blog. Here, I want to explain more in depth on why Nikola is, to me, the best choice for a static generator.</p>
<h2>Over WordPress</h2>
<p>Over that year when my blog was down, I think WordPress made some changes with their WordPress importer and I wasn't able to import from my backup file that I had. That's one reason there. I can list the other reasons along with the <a href="https://getnikola.com/features/index.html">reasons</a> stated on the Nikola's official site:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is a built-in way to write in Markdown and have it phrased.</p>

<li>
<p>A text editor of your own choice is used. Some times that is better than the web based editor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The files are stored locally and on a server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GitHub/GitHub Pages/GitLab can be used to host.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The themes are better becuase they don't have the side bar on the left-hand side.</p>

<h2>Over Jekyll</h2>
<p>I also considered using Jekyll, but I found it harder to use as a first time user of Jekyll and also for static site generators. Also <strong>(I think)</strong>, your file formats for posts must be in a certain way.</p>

<p>... <strong>FOR GOOD! And with major changes!</strong></p>
<h2>What Changed?</h2>
<p>After almost a year and two or three months, I finally got my blog running again and not with WordPress. Wordpress and JetPack/VaultPress plug-ins gave me enough headaches mainly from restoring a backup from another server/host to a new server/host. Lucky nothing was lost, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161030014830/http://senseopenness.com:80/">content</a> (thank you Internet Archive!) or money (I was able to get a full refund for both JetPack and Simple Hosting by Gandi, which I switched to).</p>
<p>I saw a <a href="https://bryanquigley.com/posts/converting/now-powered-by-gitlab-nikola-and-cloudflare.html">post</a> by Bryan Quigley about a static site generator called <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a>. Along with the reasons on why Bryan Quigley picked to use Nikola minus the WordPress import, the two main reasons why I picked Nikola is the ability to write posts/pages in Markdown and in my favorite text editor (gedit) and the ease of first time start-up and use. I decided to not use GitLabs though or Cloudflare. If you want to try Nikola on Ubuntu, Martin Wimpress wrote a <a href="https://flexion.org/posts/2015-11-installing-nikola-on-ubuntu/">great guide</a>.</p>
<p>I still have tweaks to make to the blog/site but I wanted to share the news with you.</p>
<h2>Other Updates</h2>
<p>Not that much happened over the down time, but I do have some updates to share.</p>
<h3>Grailvillie Wetlands</h3>
<p>Data collection season ended a month ago and, like always, I'm working on researching possible solutions- but this time for the Clermont Park Distinct (still under Grailville) since the Grail sold the north side of Grailville to them.  I have another season to data collect because it's a two year proccess for the transfer. Sad news, but at least I have a say in what they can do with the ponds. At least the land is going to good hands.</p>
<h3>Ubuntu</h3>
<p>Due to the lack of free time that I had, I stepped down from the CC. Mainly because I was missing the meetings because of my work schedule. There is another reason but it's something that I don't wish to share publicly at this moment in time.</p>
<p>A week before the recent Ubuntu release, I tried that said release and disliked it. The reason is simple, I may be resisting change. At least I wasn't the only one who disliked it. These people use a <a href="https://community.ubuntu.com/c/desktop/ubuntu-unity-dev">sub-forum</a> on the community.ubuntu.com site for discussions. I invite those who want Unity 7 to maintained to join. There is also a <a href="https://launchpad.net/~unity7maintainers">Launchpad team</a>.</p>
<p>I also want to share two articles on this topic:</p>
