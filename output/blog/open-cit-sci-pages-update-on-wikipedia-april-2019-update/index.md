I received a overwhelming, positive response from week one of my introductory e-mail (and blog post) about updating citizen science and Open Science pages on Wikipedia. Thank you to all who agreed to help! I learned that there is more than updating the pages and adding the missing ones.

# Updates

• I started the [navbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:CitizenScienceNavBox) with the basics that I know. There are hidden topics under the "Topics" header that need have pages to. I based them of the [working groups](https://www.citizenscience.org/association/about/working-groups/) from Citizen Science Association site as I feel that the Association is the umbrella organization for citizen science

• The talk of starting a [WikiProject or Task Force]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Belkinsa/sandbox/OpenCitSciPagesUpdate/Project-Task) is happening

• A page for [Citizen Science Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Science_Association) was created

# Next Steps

• Start grading the articles within the Citizen Science [category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Citizen_science)

• Write the proposal for the WikiProject/Task Force

In the future, the other suggestions that I saw on the [talk page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Belkinsa/sandbox/OpenCitSciPagesUpdate/Roadmap) of the roadmap will be focused on.
