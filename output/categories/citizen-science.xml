&lt;h2&gt;Blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made two major updates to the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tags Rather Than Categorizes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have decided to use tags instead of categorizes as Nikola doesn't allow comma separated categorizes. I have found that tags summarize posts better and more is better than one. I also have two posts to write about two programs that I use, which are MPV and CherryTree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Personal Links Page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to get rid of the links list on the footer as I realized how many other profile pages that I have and I want to include all of them. Instead of a footer, I created a personal links page and organized them based on what type of site it is. I also added my Telegram link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grailville Wetlands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, I finished the data analysis for the two and half data collection seasons and reported the data through a &lt;a href="https://github.com/belkinsa/GrailvilleWetlands/blob/master/WetlandProjectPaper.pdf"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, restructured the repo, and updated the index page. Most of the lessons that I learned throughout the course of time was more on the Open Science side of things; mostly with how to set up a repo on GitHub and maintaining it. I also gave the materials that are in the repo to Grailville for their archives. As of February 2019, I call the project done, although I may come back to it and work on the research portion of it or even work with the data in R to see if I can replicate the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an afterthought, I should called it Project Duckweed as a short name for the project!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open Science/Citizen Science&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still drifting with in the communities of Open Science and citizen science trying to find  to work on community development and/or engagement and I haven't had any luck. I had more leads but no go mode yet. The main lead is from the &lt;a href="https://www.citizenscience.org/"&gt;Citizen Science Association&lt;/a&gt; with their &lt;a href="https://www.citizenscience.org/association/about/working-groups/"&gt;working groups&lt;/a&gt;. As of now there is not much about these groups but I heard from a Board member that more information will be coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking why I'm having a hard time getting back into volunteering Online is either my weak skill in search kung-fu or place that has a good resource list. In response, I Tweeted this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There some wiki for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/open?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#open&lt;/a&gt; that contains resources for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/openscience?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#openscience&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/citizenscience?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#citizenscience&lt;/a&gt;? Something like how &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LiquipediaNet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@LiquipediaNet&lt;/a&gt; is set up and how it acts like an umbrella wiki.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; If not, would it be an idea that should be pursued so all of the resources and groups can be in one place?&lt;/p&gt;— Svetlana Belkin (@senseopenness) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/senseopenness/status/1106612791283195904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 15, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then after while, the thought of “oh wait, there is Wikipedia!” came to mind where I &lt;a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2019-March/092024.html"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; the same question/though on their mailing-list. And I made the newbish mistake of asking a question where the answer could of been found from doing my homework as the &lt;a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2019-March/092026.html"&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; stated. I &lt;a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2019-March/092027.html"&gt;replied&lt;/a&gt; admitting that I made the mistake and also the one that I posted to the meta Wikipedia which is the community side of Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will take on this advice and start working that on that. As a new contributor, I should take the advice of working on the low-hanging fruit rather than starting big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2019-March/092027.html"&gt;reply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I starting back at square one as I have when I first started volunteering Online in the Ubuntu Community where worked on keeping the Ubuntu Women and the main wiki up to date. But this time, I feel that I have limited information about the happenings in the Open Science/Citizen Science sector. Also, working alone, while it's okay, is a bit against the values of Open *, collaboration. I'm working on finding people with in the said sector to help me to look through the Wikipedia pages within the sector. If you want to help, please contact me via e-mail (belkinsa@fastmail.com) or via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/senseopenness"&gt;Twitter DM&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://telegram.me/belkinsa"&gt;Telegram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step that I see is to work on a roadmap and maybe post it here for everyone to understand what I'm trying to do. Look for that next month!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Citizen Science</category><category>Grailville Wetlands</category><category>News</category><category>Open Science</category><category>Wikipedia</category><guid>https://belkinsa.github.io/SenseOpenness/blog/march-2018-update/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2019 20:37:44 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
