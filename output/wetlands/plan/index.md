#2016

## Fish

Because it's becoming the end of the season, it's too late to add fish to the small pond.  That will be done next year.

## Duckweed

Since there is no fish in the pond, there is no way to clean up the duckweed without removing it manually.  The only idea is to "harvest" it, meaning that we (Grailville) offer those who wish to use it for cooking, feed, and fertilizer for free.

## Muck

Continue using the nibbers.  Try to get one in the middle of the pond, but away from the edge by the dock.

## Plants

Move them away from the edge.

## Equipment Needed

- Kayak
- Pond aerator (need to be found)
- Net
- Nibbers

#2017

## Fish

Just a suggestion at this time:

A combination of koi and grass carp should work.  The koi can go at the duckweed while the carp can go at the other things in the pond.

## Plants

Mary Lu will start the plants in pots before they will be placed in the ponds, these are:

- Daylilies
- ???
- ???
- ???

And try to get them in the middle of the pond.

## Duckweed

Try to do the same like in 2016.

## Muck

Use nibbers like in 2016.

## Equipment Needed

- Kayak
- Pond aerator (need to be found)
- Net
- Nibblers

#2018

## Fish

N/A

## Plants

One possible experiment could be having the small rafts just have pots with soil and fiber and allow the aquatic plants to live for a season.

## Duckweed

Try to find the source of the pollution rather than removing the duckweed. **Rationale:** Duckweed thrives on unhealthy ponds.

## Pond Aeration

Try to remove the aerator from the big pond and place it in the small pond. **Rationale:** As said above, a possible source of pollution is the lack of dissolved oxygen.

**03/01/18:** Found out that the aerator is broken, nothing can be done.

## Muck

Use nibblers like in 2016 and 2017.

## Equipment Needed

- Kayak
- Rafts
- Nibblers
