This tweet stuck out me not for the productivity side of things but in terms of workflow. I ditched hierarchical note taking programs (KeepNote and Cherry Tree as examples) because I noticed that I never really used them and I was over complicating things. But the one thing that stayed with me is the use of Plain Text, A.K.A writing in Markdown. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be used everywhere- only need a text editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can still have formating via markup languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small file size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy and pasting is easier because the formating is lost in Plain Text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And these pros win over the two cons that I can name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can't really do the classic outline formating.  The closest that I have is this (with spaces between the lines):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Header 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Header 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ordered Item 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Tab or four (4) lines) Unordered Item 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Outline in Markdown" src="http://senseopenness.com/Images/Blog/SenseOpenness/WhyPlainText/OutlineinMarkdown.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This outline system allows you to write content without using classic outlining formating if you want to write longer items for each points without making it hard to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The need for a previewer for markup languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I found a Markdown editor/live previewer called &lt;a href="https://github.com/retext-project/retext"&gt;reText&lt;/a&gt; which, to me, is better than GitHub's Atom or QOwnNotes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason, over Atom, is reText dedicated for Markdown but you can still open other plain text files.  Atom is also really meant for developers. Over QOwnNotes, reText is not a hierarchical note taking program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how I draft in Markdown in reText:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Drafting in Markdown" src="http://senseopenness.com/Images/Blog//SenseOpenness/WhyPlainText/DraftingMarkdown.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that working in the Open is allowing me to think in different ways of how to do thing and this is one example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT TO ADD:&lt;/strong&gt; I forgot to talk about  that Plain Text formats don't change over versions of programs and the formats are mostly Open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>workflow</category><guid>https://belkinsa.github.io/SenseOpenness/posts/why-plaintext/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Mar 2018 18:46:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Landing Page Now Live!</title><link>https://belkinsa.github.io/SenseOpenness/posts/landing-page-now-live/</link><dc:creator>Svetlana Belkin</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I stated before, I switched from WordPress to Nikola but I lost the landing/home page that I had. It's something that I feel a website needs. I tired to use Gandi's free web page hosting service and I was able to create a page but not having it live. I think it's due to Gandi updating their services from v4 to v5. Due to this, I asked a few people and decided to follow what &lt;a href="https://ahoneybun.net/"&gt;Aaron Honeycutt&lt;/a&gt; did for his landing page. I made some changes though which are the color scheme to match the logo's, made the text to suit my liking, and added a link to my Ubuntu Wiki page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Aaron, I'm using Linode for server hosting. Again, Gandi's Simple Hosting is not being nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this is the last major change I do for my site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit to Add:&lt;/strong&gt; I removed the link to the landing page but it's senseopenness.com, just Copy and Paste it. Gandi's sever hosting is pricey and I would rather pay $7 a month than like $10+.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>news</category><guid>https://belkinsa.github.io/SenseOpenness/posts/landing-page-now-live/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 18:36:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Why Nikola</title><link>https://belkinsa.github.io/SenseOpenness/posts/why-nikola/</link><dc:creator>Svetlana Belkin</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I stated previously, I switched from WordPress to Nikola for hosting my blog. Here, I want to explain more in depth on why Nikola is, to me, the best choice for a static generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Over WordPress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over that year when my blog was down, I think WordPress made some changes with their WordPress importer and I wasn't able to import from my backup file that I had. That's one reason there. I can list the other reasons along with the &lt;a href="https://getnikola.com/features/index.html"&gt;reasons&lt;/a&gt; stated on the Nikola's official site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a built-in way to write in Markdown and have it phrased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A text editor of your own choice is used. Some times that is better than the web based editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The files are stored locally and on a server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub/GitHub Pages/GitLab can be used to host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The themes are better becuase they don't have the side bar on the left-hand side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Over Jekyll&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also considered using Jekyll, but I found it harder to use as a first time user of Jekyll and also for static site generators. Also &lt;strong&gt;(I think)&lt;/strong&gt;, your file formats for posts must be in a certain way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>ubuntu</category><guid>https://belkinsa.github.io/SenseOpenness/posts/why-nikola/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 19:51:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>And We Are Back...</title><link>https://belkinsa.github.io/SenseOpenness/posts/and-we-are-back/</link><dc:creator>Svetlana Belkin</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;... &lt;strong&gt;FOR GOOD! And with major changes!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Changed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After almost a year and two or three months, I finally got my blog running again and not with WordPress. Wordpress and JetPack/VaultPress plug-ins gave me enough headaches mainly from restoring a backup from another server/host to a new server/host. Lucky nothing was lost, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161030014830/http://senseopenness.com:80/"&gt;content&lt;/a&gt; (thank you Internet Archive!) or money (I was able to get a full refund for both JetPack and Simple Hosting by Gandi, which I switched to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a &lt;a href="https://bryanquigley.com/posts/converting/now-powered-by-gitlab-nikola-and-cloudflare.html"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; by Bryan Quigley about a static site generator called &lt;a href="https://getnikola.com/"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;. Along with the reasons on why Bryan Quigley picked to use Nikola minus the WordPress import, the two main reasons why I picked Nikola is the ability to write posts/pages in Markdown and in my favorite text editor (gedit) and the ease of first time start-up and use. I decided to not use GitLabs though or Cloudflare. If you want to try Nikola on Ubuntu, Martin Wimpress wrote a &lt;a href="https://flexion.org/posts/2015-11-installing-nikola-on-ubuntu/"&gt;great guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have tweaks to make to the blog/site but I wanted to share the news with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that much happened over the down time, but I do have some updates to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Grailvillie Wetlands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data collection season ended a month ago and, like always, I'm working on researching possible solutions- but this time for the Clermont Park Distinct (still under Grailville) since the Grail sold the north side of Grailville to them.  I have another season to data collect because it's a two year proccess for the transfer. Sad news, but at least I have a say in what they can do with the ponds. At least the land is going to good hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the lack of free time that I had, I stepped down from the CC. Mainly because I was missing the meetings because of my work schedule. There is another reason but it's something that I don't wish to share publicly at this moment in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week before the recent Ubuntu release, I tried that said release and disliked it. The reason is simple, I may be resisting change. At least I wasn't the only one who disliked it. These people use a &lt;a href="https://community.ubuntu.com/c/desktop/ubuntu-unity-dev"&gt;sub-forum&lt;/a&gt; on the community.ubuntu.com site for discussions. I invite those who want Unity 7 to maintained to join. There is also a &lt;a href="https://launchpad.net/~unity7maintainers"&gt;Launchpad team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to share two articles on this topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/11/ubuntu-unity-remix"&gt;Miss Unity? An âUbuntu Unity Remixâ Could Be on the Wayâ¦&lt;/a&gt; via OMG! Ubuntu!&lt;/li&gt;
